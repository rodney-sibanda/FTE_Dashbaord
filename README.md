# FTE Dashboard for Resource Analytics and Turnover Reporting

# About this Project

In collaboration with ATB, I took on the role of a student business analyst to automate and streamline the monthly resource management and turnover reporting process. The objective was to transition from a labor-intensive, manual data entry approach to an automated, data-driven dashboard. The dashboard, designed to replace the monthly emails sent to executives, aggregates various key metrics across six distinct pages: Overview, Resource Management, Movement and Role Breakdown, Exits and Leaves, Job Posting Report, and Turnover.

# Problem Statement

My manager had been manually populating a resource management report each month, a time-consuming process that also increased the risk of human error. This approach did not support real-time decision-making. The aim was to create a dashboard that would not only automate this process but also offer actionable insights into resource management and turnover metrics.

# Key Features

## Overview Page

**By Month Filter:** The FTE Dashboard introduces a highly intuitive 'By Month' filter that allows for a chronological examination of the Full-Time Equivalent data. This feature enables decision-makers to evaluate both short-term trends and long-term patterns, offering a versatile approach to organizational analysis. Whether it's a seasonal uptick in employee turnover or a month-by-month tracking of resource allocation, the 'By Month' filter provides a temporal lens that adds depth to the data on display.

**By Department Filter:** Equally robust is the 'By Department' filter that allows for granular exploration of data across different departments within the organization. Managers and executives can isolate variables department-wise to generate tailored reports and insights. Whether the focus is on the Marketing team's efficiency or the Engineering department's turnover rate, this filter offers a customizable experience that caters to the unique needs of each department.

These dynamic controls are more than mere sorting tools; they're enablers that enhance the analytical capabilities of the FTE Dashboard. By offering customized views, these filters empower users to perform detailed evaluations that feed into more precise, effective decision-making processes. These filters, when used in combination or separately, greatly expand the dashboardâ€™s utility, providing targeted data that can drive specific initiatives or broader organizational strategy.

# Data Preparation and Upload: An Essential Prelude to Dashboard Utility

The integrity and reliability of the FTE Dashboard hinge on the quality of the data fed into it. Recognizing the transitional period as summer term comes to an end and as I prepare for my departure from the project, the need for a standardized and easily comprehensible process became imperative. It's all too common for valuable institutional knowledge to exit along with the staff who hold it. To mitigate this, I created the "Resource Management Report (RMR) - Data Preparation & Upload" work aid. This ensures that the detailed procedures and best practices that have been fine-tuned over time are not lost but are instead passed down for continuity and efficiency.

## Work Aid: A Lifeline for Consistent Data Operations

**Work Aid: Resource Management Report (RMR) - Data Preparation & Upload**

Designed to be both informative and practical, this work aid aims to ensure consistency and efficiency in the data preparation process for the Resource Management Report, as well as paid and unpaid leaves. The guide covers data preparation and flattening, main document creation, and month-end data procedures for leaves. For any queries or specialized needs, the guide directs users to the experts in Appscript and Looker Studio, making it an indispensable resource for all involved.

What's Inside the Work Aid?

- **_Data Preparation & Flattening:_** The initial phase entails gathering data from the FY24 - EFS Resource Management Report and manipulating it for easier handling and analysis. It includes steps like creating new workbooks for each month and flattening data.

- **_Main Document Creation:_** This segment lays out the procedures for creating a 'Main Document' which acts as the primary source file for upload into Looker Studio.

- **_Month-End Data for Paid & Unpaid Leaves:_** A specialized section is dedicated to capturing the end-of-month data on leaves, detailing how to use IMPORTRANGE for effective data transfer.
